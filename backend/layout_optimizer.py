Operations Research & Greedy Heuristic Slotting Optimization:
============================================================
Formulates warehouse slotting as a constrained Generalized Assignment Problem (GAP):
Minimize the total weighted travel demand:
    min Z = sum_{i in Products} sum_{j in Shelves} f_i * d_j * x_{ij}
Subject to:
    1. sum_{j in Shelves} x_{ij} = 1, for all i in Products (Every product must be assigned)
    2. sum_{i in Products} x_{ij} <= C_j, for all j in Shelves (Shelf capacity constraint)
    3. x_{ij} + x_{kj} <= 1, for all j, for (i, k) in IncompatibleCategories (Safety segregation)
    4. x_{ij} in {0, 1}

Heuristic Execution:
- Implements Pareto ABC Analysis: Sorts products descending by pick frequency f_i.
- Sorts candidate storage shelves ascending by corridor distance to dispatch hub d_j.
- Greedily assigns high-velocity (Tier A) items to closest available shelves under constraints.
