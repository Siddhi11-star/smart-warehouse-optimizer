Operations Research: Multiple Traveling Salesperson Problem (mTSP) & Fleet Balancing:
====================================================================================
Assigns pending warehouse orders/tours across a fleet of M pickers (e.g. Workers 1, 2, 3)
to optimize warehouse shift throughput.

Objectives:
1. Min-Max Makespan: Minimize the maximum completion time across all workers:
       min max_{w in Workers} TotalDistance(w)
   Ensures the entire order wave finishes as fast as possible without bottlenecks.
2. Workload Equity & Fatigue Prevention:
   Balances the physical travel demand (meters walked) across workers, minimizing
   workload variance and the Gini coefficient:
       G = sum_i sum_j |D_i - D_j| / (2 * M * sum_i D_i)
3. Zone Deconfliction:
   Groups orders with shared primary aisle footprints to minimize corridor congestion.
